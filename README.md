# SciCom Website

##### Basics of SciCom:
The site contains the most useful formulas and such, to supplement univeristy studies in SciCom.

##### Website architecture:
The site is relatively simple structure, with things added along the way, as I learned how to make websites.
You are welcome to take inspiration in the code, but **not allowed** to re-distribute all the specific material I have added on site.
For the concrete materials, all rights are reserved. 

##### External materials:
The icon for the website found through Freepik. 
Otherwise materials on the website, that I have not made myself, always have direct references on the site. # scicom
