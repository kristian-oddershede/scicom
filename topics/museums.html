      <h2>Why science museums and centers matter</h2>
      <p>
        Science museums and science centers remain trusted spaces for public engagement with science. Today, both often include interactive elements, but their defining difference lies in whether they also steward historical collections or focus solely on phenomena and experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Museums combine authentic artifacts with interactive design, while centers emphasize hands‑on inquiry without collections. Understanding this distinction helps communicators design experiences that balance evidence, play, and trust.

      Main thing to know: <br />
      Science museums make science accessible, engaging, and relevant through historical objects 
      and interactive exhibits that ignite curiosity and demonstrate the applications of science in everyday life.

      <h2>Definitions and core differences</h2>
      <h3>Science museums</h3>
      <p>
        Institutions that steward scientific artifacts, specimens, and instruments while also offering interactive experiences. Their strength lies in combining provenance and authenticity with modern engagement strategies.
      </p>
      <h3>Science centers</h3>
      <p>
        Institutions that focus exclusively on interactive, inquiry‑based exhibits without historical collections. They prioritize experimentation, play, and visitor‑driven discovery.
      </p>

    <!-- Expanded Co-Creation Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Co‑creation – newest trends in science museums</h2>
      <p>
        Co‑creation goes beyond consultation: it involves the public as active partners in shaping exhibitions. Rather than experts designing for audiences, museums and centers design with audiences.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaborative design workshops:</strong> Invite community members to co‑develop exhibit themes and prototypes.</li>
        <li><strong>Citizen science integration:</strong> Exhibits that incorporate visitor‑generated data and local research projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared authority:</strong> Communities help decide which stories, artifacts, or phenomena are highlighted.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative feedback loops:</strong> Exhibits evolve continuously based on visitor input and co‑testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Equity and representation:</strong> Co‑creation ensures diverse voices shape what counts as science in public spaces.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This approach strengthens trust, relevance, and inclusivity by making science communication a two‑way process.
